# 2017FRCVisionTrial
This project is based on the Intermeidate Vision Sample code provided in WPI's Example Robot C++ Project. It aims to provide a solution for FRC teams seeking to use computer vision in their robot project. 

# Description
This code uses the cpp code generated by GRIP as a external class (Class Pipeline), providing an alternative way to intergarte GRIP into a RoboRIO project. 

*Including an external OpenCV library in the robot project is no longer necessary. WPILib has already inculded a prebuilt version of OpenCV library in both Java and C++ Eclipse plugins.*

**Please see wiki for more information.**

**A Java verison of the code is also availiable [here](https://github.com/WilliamHuang-cn/2017VisionTrialJava)**
