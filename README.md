# 2017FRCVisionTrial
This project is based on the Intermeidate Vision Sample code provided in WPI's Example Robot C++ Project. It aims to provide a solution for FRC teams seeking to use computer vision in their robot project. 

# Description
This code uses the cpp code generated by GRIP as a external class (Class Pipeline), providing an alternative way to intergarte GRIP into a RoboRIO project. However, different from the means provided by GRIP project (https://github.com/WPIRoboticsProjects/GRIP/wiki/Tutorial:-Run-GRIP-from-a-CPP,-Java,-or-LabVIEW-FRC-program), including an OpenCV library on both Eclipse and RoboRIO before delopyng this project is necessary.

# Notes For Using This Project
1. Download an OpenCV release from the following repository: https://github.com/robotpy/roborio-opencv/releases
2. Place the extracted file in the same folder as wpilib, which should be in your home directory.
3. Refer to the instructions provided here to install OpenCV library on your RoboRIO: https://github.com/robotpy/roborio-opencv/blob/master/README.md
4. Build and deploy this project.

# Thanks
Thanks to team2053tigertronics who inspires this project with their guide to inlcude OpenCV libs in Eclipse and virtuald who makes using OpenCV libs on RoboRIO possible.
